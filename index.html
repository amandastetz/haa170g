                Historically, the phrase “the town and gown” has been used to describe the two distinct communities
                living within a university town.
            </h1>
            <br>
            <h4 class="bodyText thin" style="color: white">
                The “town” being the community’s non-academic residents and the
                “gown” being all those associated with the university – students, facility, and staff, amongst
                others.
                <br><br>
                Fittingly, <i>Town Gown</i> is the name of the report Harvard, MIT, Lesley University, and Cambridge College
                each release annually to the public to describe what they have been doing for the past year. It also describes what
                their future plans are regarding topics like land ownership, student and staff statistics, building
                renovations and construction, and energy consumption.<sup>1</sup> Harvard University has called the report a
                “snapshot of Harvard’s presence in Cambridge”.<sup>2</sup>
                <br><br>
                The following data story is inspired by this town-gown
                relationship as it applies to Harvard University and the communities surrounding it: Harvard Square,
                greater-Cambridge, Allston, and more.
                It uses data from various Harvard <i>Town Gown</i> reports,
                Harvard GIS data, and other open-source databases, to look
                at what occurs when the “town and gown” relationship becomes one of “town <i>versus</i> gown”.

            <h4 class="bodyText thin" style="color: white">
                So, what does town versus gown look like, and why is this relationship relevant? To understand, it is
                first important to recognize Harvard’s growing physical presence, how it affects the community around
                it, and the community’s response to it.

                As seen below, Harvard’s presence beyond its main campus has been slowly expanding as well since 2002.

                The University currently owns land in Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Washington D.C., and
                Wyoming. It also maintains an international presence through centers in Italy, Greece, and Turkey.
                In total, these holdings account for 25.8 million square feet of building space, and 5669 acres of land
                as of 2021.<sup>4</sup>

                        While the university’s expansion may not be negative in-and-of-itself, its expansion does not occur in
                        a vacuum.
                    </h1>
                    <br>
                <h4 class="bodyText thin" style="font-weight: 300;">
                    The communities Harvard is most immediately expanding into – Cambridge and Allston – are
                    densely populated with little land available, meaning Harvard’s expansion is a zero-sum game: for the
                    university to acquire new property, people, often entire communities, must be driven out. And those
                    that stay, often do not remain for long.
                    <br><br>
                    Here the distinction between the town and gown is most apparent, because the residents of these
                    communities the university seeps into do not benefit from its wealth nor the resources it provides
                    internally. Rather, the immediate effects of Harvard’s expansion come in the form of skyrocketing
                    property values and costs of living, which are impossible to keep up with on a stagnant income.<sup>5</sup>

                    Local residents and businesses are effectively priced out of communities they may have spent decades in.
                    Yet, this story is not new.
                    <br><br>
                    In fact, Harvard has been in a state of continuous growth for over a century.
                    To secure and maintain its property holdings at this rate, Harvard has drawn from the same playbook for
                    nearly 400 years.
                    <br><br>
                    The following sections, showcase the university’s physical expansion,
                    and explain Harvard’s motives for expansion and how its role within the broader community
                    has changed from 1636 to today. Understanding the evolving town-gown relationship will help make sense
                    of the current relationship between Harvard Square, great-Cambridge, Allston, and Harvard.

                            The first 230 years of Harvard’s physical presence in Cambridge was almost entirely limited
                            to around twenty substantial buildings.

                        Almost all of which were contained within what is
                        known as Old Yard today. Near the beginning of the 19th century, the university began its
                        first expansion – 64 acres into the north of Harvard Yard – yet this expansion did not
                        interrupt Cambridge’s own growth.<sup>7</sup>
                        <br><br>
                        In these early years the college maintained a small student body size, around two hundred, and
                        most students lived in private homes off-campus, yet the “town versus gown” relationship still
                        saw its roots in this period.

                                    Notably, it was not the nature of the university expanding that
                                    created conflict with the town surrounding it, but rather it was the disposition of the
                                    students.

                        so was able to practically double the amount of buildings on Harvard’s campus.<sup>9</sup> It was during this
                        time that Harvard’s relationship with the local government and residents took shape.
                        <br><br>
                        During the 1890s there were talks by the Cambridge government about rolling back the blanketed
                        tax-exemptions Harvard enjoyed on almost every building.

                                    institutions could not be taxed, new legislation was passed which ended tax-exemption for
                                    properties whose income was not used for educational purposes and for properties which were
                                    not occupied for educational purposes.<sup>10</sup>

                        between Harvard and local governments over its tax-exempt status.
                        <br><br>
                        During this time, Harvard also forged a symbiotic relationship with the town of Cambridge.
                        Eliot was a strong proponent of the German university model, which believed that a university
                        should only provide classrooms and libraries to its students, not housing or other amenities.
                        As a result, Eliot created a liberalized housing policy, where most Harvard students lived and
                        ate off campus.
                        <br><br>
                        This created new demand for private dormitories, apartments, and cafeteria
                        facilities, often run by Cambridge residents. The surge of the student population also strengthened
                        the economy of Harvard Square, driving demand for restaurants, repair shops, and other local businesses.

                            The presidency of Abbott Lawrence Lowell is perhaps the most pivotal period within Harvard’s
                            history of expansion.
                        </span>
                        <br><br>
                        The actions of Lowell not only changed the course of the institution’s
                        housing policies but in doing so they created the first major rift between the university and
                        the residents of Harvard Square.
                        <br><br>
                        While Eliot’s housing policy may have been beneficial for business owners in the Square, it
                        created immense inequalities in quality of life for Harvard students. Since the quality and
                        location of housing was subject to how much students could afford, poor students were required
                        to live miles away from Harvard Square to obtain affordable housing, while richer students
                        occupied luxury dormitories and dining halls a mere minutes walk from Harvard Yard. This split
                        was not only in living conditions, it fragmented the student body along class lines.
                        <br><br>
                        As an attempt to remedy this Lowell established the Housing System as it is known today, where
                        all Harvard students are able to live on campus in shared dormitories, regardless of class
                        affiliation. To make this a reality Lowell underwent one of the most substantial building
                        projects in Harvard’s history, constructing several dormitories along the Charles River in
                        addition to other academic buildings along the Yard.
                        <br><br>
                        While the result may have equalized the field for Harvard students, it had detrimental effects
                        on the Cambridge community in two ways. First, all of the residents whose livelihoods were
                        dependent on running housing and other amenities for the students were suddenly put out of
                        business. Second, the means by which Lowell acquired almost all the land along the Charles
                        River were immensely deceptive, if not outright destructive to communities.

                                    From a period of roughly 1902 - 1932, Lowell used proxy real estate agents to secretly buy
                                    almost all of the land along the Charles River.<sup>11</sup>

                        This area along the river originally housed a large
                        working-class immigrant community. However, it was systematically cleared away through a series
                        of aggressive purchases and persuasion by two Harvard alumni. Residents often did not know they
                        were signing their property over to the university nor that they were being swindled into the
                        lowest prices possible.
                        <br><br>
                        This land grab bolstered the university’s wealth at the expense of losing the trust of city
                        residents and the local government as well. During this time, around 1928, when tensions were
                        high the university promised to “pay a sum in lieu of taxes on the properties it might acquire
                        over the next twenty years”,<sup>12</sup> marking the beginning of a long history of the university promising
                        “payments in lieu of taxes”, to the city as compensation, otherwise known as PILOT funds.

                            The era between Lowell’s presidency and Harvard in the 21st century was again one of immense
                            expansion.
                        </span>
                        <br><br>
                        From 1953 - 1971, during Nathan Pusey’s presidency Harvard entered its most prolific
                        building era during these postwar years, and in doing so was required to negotiate its PILOT payments.<sup>13</sup>
                        <br><br>
                        Three new freshman dormitories and three new upperclassmen Houses along the River were constructed,
                        along with a variety of other academic facilities. These construction projects for the first time
                        added skyscrapers – William James Hall and Mather House – to Harvard’s real estate portfolio.
                        <br><br>
                        While this construction occurred the city remained deeply cynical of the university’s intentions
                        and capabilities.<sup>14</sup> The community had not forgotten about the secret purchasing that occurred earlier
                        in the century, and as a result, popular imagination characterized the university as no better
                        than a real-estate speculator. In many ways Harvard was just that, prior to Pusey’s presidency
                        the university frequently landbanked properties, meaning it bought real estate with the intention
                        of later demolishing it, which in the eyes of the university meant there was no incentive to upkeep
                        the properties. As a result, Harvard let these buildings decay to the detriment and danger of those
                        inhabiting it.
                        <br><br>
                        To assess the university’s image in light of this friction between the town and gown, Pusey
                        organized the creation of a “Committee on the University and the City”, composed of Harvard
                        faculty and staff.

                                    In their report, and much to the town’s dismay, the committee talked of a
                                    natural trajectory towards a “Harvardized” future for Cambridge (gentrification).<sup>15</sup>

                        living in the area, and to this day Harvard largely continues to live up to that image.

                        In 1997, Harvard University disclosed that for the previous nine years they had spent nearly $88
                        million buying 52 acres of land in Allston, Massachusetts behind Harvard Business School
                        and Harvard’s athletic complexes.<sup>17</sup> Echoing the actions of almost a century earlier, the process
                        had been conducted secretly under the name of an unaffiliated private real estate company,
                        meaning the university’s identity was unknown to sellers, Allston residents, and local
                        government officials.
                        <br><br>
                        Harvard claims to have done so out of necessity, stating that if they went through with the
                        purchases under the university name, the prices would have been inflated beyond their
                        fair market value.<sup>18</sup> Allston residents, on the other hand, viewed the terms of the purchases as deception.
                        <br><br>
                        Residents did not want the university further encroaching on their community, as it
                        typically translates to a higher cost of living, less resources for residents, and greater
                        gentrification. To mitigate these tensions, Harvard promised to remain “very sensitive to
                        community interests” when it came to deciding the use of said properties.<sup>19</sup>

                                    approximately ⅓ of the land in Allston.<sup>20</sup>

                        these are just the start. As Harvard rolls out its plan for the remodeling of more of its
                        Allston properties, it claims once again for these projects to be in service of the community.<sup>21</sup>
                        However, the reality of the situation is not so simple, especially with mounting opposition
                        from neighborhood groups.

                        The “Allston Question” is perhaps the most symbolic of Harvard’s contemporary relationship with
                        the communities it inhabits. The remainder of this data story will focus on Harvard’s presence
                        in Allston to outline the current effects of expansion.

                        In 2002 the amount of acreage Harvard held in Allston surpassed that in Cambridge, and this
                        amount has remained significantly greater ever since, with a trajectory to acquire even more.
                        Most of this land remains undeveloped, explaining the lower gross square footage in Allston

                        unveils its Allston initiative.

                        Harvard may continue to expand, but that does not mean it does so without pushback.
                        The effects of Harvard’s expansion have historically affected communities along two axes:
                        culturally and financially. As a result, voices against Harvard focus their attention on
                        gentrification and taxation.

                    <h4 class="bodyText thin">
                        Gentrification is a term to describe the process by which an area experiences an influx of
                        wealthier people who through renovations to homes and businesses increase the area’s property
                        value and displace its previous inhabitants. As a result, the “essential character” of a community,
                        which is defined by the people and culture within it, changes.
                        <br><br>
                        As reports from the Harvard Open Data Project<sup>22</sup> reveal, gentrification is a consequence of, and
                        arguably a necessity for, Harvard’s expansion. The Harvard Corporation, who oversees the
                        university’s budget, is incentivized to prioritize the interests of the university over those
                        within the communities it enters. As a result, Harvard reshapes the communities surrounding it.
                        <br><br>
                        How does this happen?
                        <br><br>
                        Between 2002 and 2021, Harvard increased the amount of square footage it owned in Cambridge
                        by 24%. The result?

                                    In those same years the average home price in Cambridge rose by over 150%, 35 times
                                    higher than the national rate of appreciation: 4.27%.<sup>23</sup>

                        Given these rates it is no surprise that
                        residents are being priced-out and displaced from their neighborhoods. This runs in stark
                        contrast to Harvard’s continual expansion of the student body. When looking at the steadily
                        rising residential portion of Harvard’s building use, it is clear that while the student
                        housing market flourishes, non-student residents pay the price – something which echoes the
                        struggles residents faced back in the early 1900s when Harvard moved to the on-campus housing
                        system. Today, even residents who do not leave, experience their community’s resources and
                        opportunities retract, as many of the jobs Harvard provides, beyond entry level, do not reflect
                        the communities they serve.<sup>24</sup>

                        HOPD has shown that the fundamental characteristics of communities change once Harvard enters
                        them, finding a direct correlation between Harvard’s growth and shrinking populations of
                        low-income people of color.<sup>25</sup> With these findings in mind it is no surprise that many Allston
                        residents have a “fear of Harvard just kind of coming in and swallowing the neighborhood.”<sup>26</sup>
                        Arguably, the motivation for Harvard entering Allston was due to them exhausting the communities
                        they could displace to make room for more university buildings.
                        <br><br>
                        In 2011, the former head of Harvard Real Estate and former Vice President for administration,
                        Sally Zeckhauser, spoke on Harvarding “running out of space” in Cambridge, stating that the
                        university was bumping up against “mature neighborhoods with sophisticated and politically
                        active residents often seeking to preserve things just as they were.”<sup>27</sup> The result? A move to
                        an area with less “sophisticated and politically active residents”, a phrase which is largely
                        a “dog-whistle for low-income and people of color.”<sup>28</sup> The University determined this was Allston,
                        which explains the beginning of their development plans there in 2013.

                        Harvard may exist within various communities but that does not mean it is fundamentally a part
                        of them. In fact, the communities Harvard lies in are often responsible for footing the bill
                        of the university. As non-profit organizations, universities are exempt from paying property
                        taxes,<sup>29</sup> even in places like the Boston area, where over 50% of land is tax-exempt due to its
                        non-profit or governmental use.<sup>30</sup>

                                    The most recent Harvard Town Gown report shows that in 2020 Harvard owned 191.8 acres of
                                    land in Cambridge yet only 22.4 – a mere 12% – is taxable.

                        <br>
                        Why is this a problem? Well, 70% of Boston’s budget and 65% of Cambridge’s budget comes from
                        property taxes.<sup>31</sup> As a result, costs of snow removal, road maintenance, police and fire protection,
                        and other local services disproportionately fall on town residents, despite Harvard affiliates
                        benefiting from these services as well.
                        <br><br>
                        In an attempt to make up for these loses, in 2011 Cambridge and Boston established a new Payment in
                        Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) program, which asks nonprofit institutions, educational, medical, or
                        cultural, whose property is valued at over $15 million to donate around 25% of their assessed
                        property tax value per year.<sup>32</sup>
                        <br><br>
                        There is even an arrangement called “community benefits” which allows up to half of the
                        institution’s expected contributions to PILOT to be fulfilled through “services that
                        directly benefit City of Boston residents.”<sup>33</sup> The purported goal is to create an impact
                        equivalent to the dollar amount that would have been paid.
                        <br><br>
                        While in theory this PILOT program sounds strong, the reality is far from it. A major caveat
                        of PILOT is that cities cannot legally require institutions to comply with PILOT payment amounts,
                        since as mentioned these institutions are protected by law as tax-exempt. Hence all contributions
                        are entirely voluntary – which is reflected by Harvard’s participation in PILOT.
                        <br><br>
                        As of 2021, Harvard has never paid the full amount of their share, approximately $12.8 million.
                        When they do offer payment, often over half of it is through “community benefits” credit.<sup>34</sup> The
                        broad nature of the terms of “community benefits” has allowed the university to create programs
                        with very little direct impact on the Boston communities that need them most.

                        Harvard’s expansion into Allston warrants fears for both the culture of the city and its
                        financial stability. Which is why Harvard’s newest building project in Allston, the Enterprise
                        Research Campus (ERC), has already faced immense pushback from community groups.
                        <br><br>
                        Since 2002 Harvard has dedicated a significant amount of its building ownership to undeveloped
                        land and developing real estate, and clearly is on no track to stop. The ERC would be one of
                        Harvard’s most ambitious projects yet. The ERC was pitched in 2021 to be “900,000 square
                        feet of mixed-use development consisting of residential, office/lab, hotel, conference center,
                        restaurant, and retail use” located in Allston between Western Avenue and Cambridge Street.<sup>39</sup>
                        The area would be enveloped by over two acres of public open space with greenways and other
                        sustainable architectures.

                        of the Allston community”<sup>40</sup> which is why Harvard has pledged to actions such as:
                        allocate 20% of the ERC as publicly accessible open space; donate land for affordable housing;
                        ensure that 20% of the housing units in the ERC would be income restricted; provide up to
                        $10 million over five years for affordable-housing creation and preservation; ensure that a

                        Despite large overlap in demands by both Harvard and Allston residents for transportation,
                        affordable housing, public spaces, and professional development, neighborhood groups like
                        Coalition for a Just Allston-Brighton remain wary. They voice a stronger desire for a “more
                        comprehensive approach to development planning and more engagement by Harvard – as opposed
                        to independent developers – in broad community-planning efforts.”<sup>42</sup>

                        It is clear through nearly 400 years of history, expansion is something deeply intertwined
                        with the university, and something that has consistently detrimental first the residents
                        of Harvard Square, then of greater-Cambridge, and now of Allston.

                    <h4 class="bodyText thin">
                        As a result, Harvard has
                        used similar tactics throughout the years to acquire and maintain its property. The
                        relationship between the town and gown has become one of town versus gown due to the
                        fact that many of those living within the communities around Harvard, at best, never
                        experience the resources of the university. While at worst, these residents are negatively
                        impacted through rising housing prices, a loss of the essential character of their community,
                        and have to front the cost of the university’s consumption of public service due to Harvard
                        refusing to pay their PILOT contributions and not providing meaningful community services in
                        lieu of them either.
                        <br><br>
                        The narrative of Harvard’s expansion though is not entirely black-and-white, especially given
                        how the history of Harvard’s expansion into Harvard Square, Cambridge, and now Allston often
                        overshadows the efforts the university makes to help these communities. Harvard has an equally
                        long history of providing aid and other programs to residents, including home ownership programs
                        in Allston,<sup>43</sup> running homeless shelters in Harvard Square, running a flex fund to improve public
                        spaces,<sup>44</sup> and partnering with Boston public schools among many other charitable initiatives.<sup>45</sup>
                        <br><br>
                        The detrimental effects of Harvard’s expansion are a result of an imbalance of power between the
                        university and the communities surrounding it. There lacks a fundamental partnership between the
                        university and its towns, arguably due to Harvard’s unwillingness to relinquish their power over
                        the community – the one action needed to truly partner.

                    <h4 class="bodyText thin">
                        The university is aware of the negative
                        effects it has on these communities, yet continually decides to remain unchanged. This is why
                        many of the efforts Harvard makes to improve communities can be seen as reparations for the very
                        problems Harvard has caused. These actions do not deepen Harvard’s ties with the greater community,
                        rather, they only absolve Harvard from engaging with it on equal terms.
                        <br><br>
                        In order to create true change an equal partnership would need to emerge, which requires thinking
                        creatively and redefining traditional approaches. Various community groups have already spoken on
                        what Harvard can do to create this. For example, the PILOT Action Group has suggested the following
                        terms to remedy the system:

                        Harvard could also adopt the pledges it made for affordable housing, transportation, and
                        professional development for the community within the ERC, to all of its proposals.
                        As efforts like these work towards a more balanced partnership, local governments will
                        also need to rethink the way Harvard is being held accountable in the meantime.

                        Whether such a partnership is attainable, or even favorable for these communities, remains an
